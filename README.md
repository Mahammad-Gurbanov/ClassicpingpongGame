Classic Arcade Ping-Pong game

This is my first personal project using pygame to create 2d games.
As you all know Classic Ping-Pong game is a classic, and I wanted to start 
my journey with creating ping-pong game from scratch using the pygame module 
in python.
For now the game is in the process of being built so all the settings aren't 
configured yet, and the game is a far way from its final version. So far 
it's a multiplayer game, which you can control left paddle with _WASD_ and right
rectangle with _arrow keys_. Feel free to correct any of my mistakes, or to 
help me to improve my code, as I would very much appreciate it. I hope that 
game is going to be fun!

**THANK YOU**
